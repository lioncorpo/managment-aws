# Billing and account activity<a name="useconsolidatedbilling-activity"></a>

Each month, AWS charges the management account owner, and not the owners of the member accounts\. To see the total usage and charges across all the accounts in an organization, see the **Bills** page of the management account\. AWS updates the page multiple times each day\. Additionally, AWS makes a downloadable cost report available each day\.

Although the owners of the member accounts aren't charged, they can still see their usage and charges by going to their AWS **Bills** pages\. They can't view or obtain data for the management account or any other member accounts on the bill\.
